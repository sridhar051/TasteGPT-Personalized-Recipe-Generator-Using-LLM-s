# TasteGPT: Personalized Recipe Generator using LLMs

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook demonstrating how to build a personalized recipe generator powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). The notebook walks through setting up dependencies, connecting to various APIs, and evaluating generated recipes.

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**

   Create a Python environment and install required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the notebook**

   Open `LLM_Sridhar_Kandi.ipynb` in Jupyter or Google Colab and execute the cells step by step. The notebook downloads models, processes user preferences, and generates recipes using OpenAI and other LLM-powered tools.

## Project Structure

- `LLM_Sridhar_Kandi.ipynb` – main notebook containing the code and explanations.
- `requirements.txt` – list of Python packages needed to run the notebook.

## Notes

The notebook was developed in Google Colab and may prompt to install additional packages during execution. Ensure that you have access to the necessary API keys (for example, OpenAI) if required by the cells.

Feel free to adapt the code for your own recipe ideas or integrate it into a larger application.
